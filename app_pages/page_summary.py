        f"* The cherry plantation crop from Cherries & Berries is facing a challenge, their cherry plantations have been infected by powdery mildew. \n"
        f"* Currently, the process is manual verification if a given cherry tree contains powdery mildew. An employee spends around 30 minutes on each tree," 
        f"* taking a few samples of tree leaves and verifying visually if the leaf tree is healthy or has powdery mildew. If there is powdery mildew,"
        f"* the employee applies a specific compound to kill the fungus.\n" 
        f"* the model data can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/codeinstitute/cherry-leaves,\n"
        f"The time spent applying this compound is 1 minute. The company has thousands of cherry trees, "
        f"located on multiple farms across the country. As a result, this manual process is not scalable due to the time spent in the manual inspection process.\n"
