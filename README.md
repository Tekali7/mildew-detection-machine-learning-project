## Business Requirements

The cherry plantation crop from Cherries & Berries is facing a challenge where their cherry plantations have been presenting powdery mildew.Currently, the process involves manually verifying whether a given cherry tree has powdery mildew. An employee spends around 30 minutes in each tree, taking a few samples of tree leaves and verifying visually if the leaf tree is healthy or has powdery mildew. If there is powdery mildew, the employee applies a specific compound to kill the fungus. The time spent applying this compound is 1 minute.  The company has thousands of cherry trees, located on multiple farms across the country. As a result, this manual process is not scalable due to the time spent in the manual inspection process.

To save time in this process, the IT team suggested an ML system that detects instantly, using an image of a cherry tree leaf, if it is healthy or has powdery mildew. A similar manual process is in place for other crops for detecting pests, and if this initiative is successful, there is a realistic chance to replicate this project for all other crops. The dataset is a collection of cherry leaf images provided by Cherries & Berries, taken from their crops.


* 1 - The client is interested in conducting a study to visually differentiate a healthy cherry leaf from one with powdery mildew.

## Hypothesis and how to Validate

Implementing a machine learning model trained on cherry leaf images will improve the accuracy and efficiency of detecting powdery mildew compared to traditional manual diagnosis methods.

* Cherry leaves with powdery mildew can be distinguished from healthy ones by their distinctive whitish appearance.
    * This can be verified by creating an average image study and image montage to determine differences in the appearance of healthy leaves and leaves with powdery mildew.
* Cherry leaves can be determined to be healthy or infected with a degree of 99% accuracy.
    * This can be verified by evaluating the model on the test dataset, which should achieve at least 99% accuracy.

## Rationale to Map the Business Requirements to the Data Visualizations and ML Tasks

### Business Requirement 1: Data Visualization

* Visual Distinction between Typical Healthy and Infected Leaves
* Collection of Images Showcasing Both Healthy and Infected Leaves

### Business Requirement 2: Classification

* Building and training a machine learning model to classify cherry leaves as either healthy or infected with powdery mildew.
* The predictions should have a 97% accuracy level.

## ML Business Case

The Cherry Leaf Mildew Detection project aims to leverage machine learning (ML) to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of identifying powdery mildew on cherry leaves.

# Rationale for the Model

An effective machine learning model makes accurate predictions by generalizing well from the training data to new, unseen data. Ideally, such a model should also be as simple as possible, avoiding unnecessary complexity in its neural network and high computational demands.

If a model is trained for too long on the training dataset or is overly complex, it might start learning the noise or irrelevant details from the data. This leads to overfitting, where the model performs exceptionally well on the training data but poorly on new data due to its inability to generalize. Overfitting can be identified by evaluating the model's performance on validation and test datasets.

Underfitting happens when the model fails to capture the underlying relationship between the input and output data. This can be detected by its poor performance on the training dataset, which usually results in similarly low accuracy on the validation and test datasets.

# Model Creation

This project focuses on image classification, requiring the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network using TensorFlow. The goal is to develop a model for categorical image classification, distinguishing between healthy and infected outcomes.

For categorical classification tasks, the approach involves choosing between two options: using a single neuron with a sigmoid activation function or employing two neurons with a softmax activation function. Both configurations were tested and fine-tuned during the experimental phase.

The final model is a sequential model that includes the following components:

* Convolutional Layers: Used to identify patterns within the image by applying filters that distinguish dominant pixel values from non-dominant ones.

* The model includes 3 convolutional layers.

* Conv2D was used as the images are in 2D.

The number of filters used were 32, 64, and 64, progressively increasing to capture more complex features.

* The kernel size of 3x3 was chosen for its efficiency.

* The activation function ReLU was used for its simplicity and effectiveness in hidden layers.

Pooling Layers: Applied following each convolutional layer to reduce the image size by capturing the most significant pixels.

* MaxPooling2D was used to emphasize the brighter pixels in the image, which helps in simplifying the image complexity.
* Flatten Layer: Converts the matrix into a vector, creating a unified list of all values to be passed into a dense layer.

Dense Layer: A densely connected neural network layer.

* 128 nodes were chosen through a process of trial and error.
* The activation function ReLU was used.
* Dropout Layer: A regularization layer implemented to mitigate the risk of overfitting in the neural network.

* A dropout rate of 0.5 was chosen.

Output Layer:

* The sigmoid activation function was determined to be optimal for binary classification. This configuration uses 1 node to provide a single output value representing the probability of the positive class (infected).
The binary_crossentropy loss function was selected, paired with the adam optimizer, chosen after thorough experimentation and testing.

# Project Outcomes
## Business Requirement 1: Data Visualization
You can view the visualization study on the [Leaves Visualizer](https://mildew-detection-ml-project-f21b18db7f24.herokuapp.com/) page of the dashboard. This study includes mean and variability images, along with an image montage that compares healthy and infected leaves. The average and variability images for healthy and infected leaves reveal subtle distinctions that are often challenging to discern. Despite the differences in leaf structure, these images occasionally show only slight variations in texture and appearance.

## Business Requirement 2: Classification
You can access the classification tool on the [Powdery Mildew Detection](https://mildew-detection-ml-project-f21b18db7f24.herokuapp.com/) page of the dashboard. Users can upload images of leaves and receive classification predictions for each image, either powdery mildew or healthy, accompanied by a probability graph. The predictions have an accuracy rate exceeding 99%.

# Hypothesis Outcomes
## Hypothesis 1
* Cherry Leaves with Powdery Mildew Can Be Differentiated from Healthy Leaves by Their Appearance

This hypothesis was validated by conducting an average image study and creating an image montage to highlight the differences in the appearance of healthy cherry leaves versus those affected by powdery mildew.

The image montage reveals that cherry leaves with powdery mildew can be identified by subtle anomalies, such as white powdery spots and leaf deformation. Consequently, the average and variability images displayed only minimal differences between healthy and infected leaves.

The average image study did not reveal clear patterns that allow for intuitive differentiation between healthy cherry leaves and those affected by powdery mildew.

To view the image montage, average and variability images, and the difference between averages study, select the 'Leaves Visualizer' option from the sidebar menu.

Conclusion: The hypothesis was partially validated. While the average and variability images showed minimal differences, subtle anomalies such as white powdery spots and leaf deformation were visible in the image montage, allowing a professional to distinguish between healthy leaves and those with powdery mildew.

## Hypothesis 2
* Leaves can be accurately classified as healthy or infected with a 99% accuracy rate.

This was confirmed by testing the model on a separate dataset.

During training and validation, the model achieved an accuracy of over 99%, and it maintained a 99% accuracy when evaluated on the test dataset.

Conclusion: The hypothesis was validated as the model, utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network, successfully classified cherry leaves as either healthy or infected with powdery mildew with an accuracy exceeding 99%.
